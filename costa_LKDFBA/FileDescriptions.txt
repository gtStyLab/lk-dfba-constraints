USER GUIDE:
1) In costaModel, generate noisy data using driver_genNoisyDatasetsCosta.m. The noiseless dataset has already been generated by Copasi ('costa_k-01_hiRes.mat').
2) To fit LK-DFBA models, use driver_costa_LKDFBA.m. Results will be saved to results_split*
3) Once LK-DFBA models have been created, use driver_predict_costa.m and driver_predict_costa_noisy.m to predict different metabolic phenotypes. Change the regName to choose which down/up regulation to use (leave blank for no regulation). glc_initial can also set the initial glucose concentration (default 40000 aka 40 mM). Results will be saved to results_split*_predict
4) Run driver_calcError_costa.m to calculate errors between predictions and ODE data.
