USER GUIDE:
1) In chassModel, generate data using driver_genDatasets_chassV.m.
2) To fit LK-DFBA models, use driver_chass_LKDFBA.m. Results will be saved to results_split*
3) Once LK-DFBA models have been created, use driver_predict_chass.m, driver_predict_chass_newModel.m, and driver_predict_chass_noisy.m to predict different metabolic phenotypes. Change the regName to choose which down/up regulation to use (leave blank for no regulation). Results will be saved to results_split*_predict
4) Run driver_calcError_chass.m and driver_calcError_chass_newModel.m to calculate errors between predictions and ODE data.
