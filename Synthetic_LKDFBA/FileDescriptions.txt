USER GUIDE:
1) In SyntheticModel, generate data using driver_genDatasetsSynthetic.m.
2) To fit LK-DFBA models, use driver_SyntheticModel_LKDFBA.m. Results will be saved to results_split*
3) Once LK-DFBA models have been created, use driver_predict_Synthetic.m to predict different metabolic phenotypes. Change the regName to choose which down/up regulation to use (leave blank for no regulation). Results will be saved to results_split*_predict
4) Run driver_calcError_Synthetic.m to calculate errors between predictions and ODE data.
